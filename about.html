            <p>
                Hello! I'm Nandini Srivastava, a creative mind with a passion for turning data into 
                actionable insights and crafting visually stunning designs. With a foundation in graphic 
                design and two years of experience, I've delved into data analytics using tools like Excel, 
                Power BI, Tableau, Python, and SQL. I've successfully completed five impactful projects 
                showcasing my expertise in transforming raw data into compelling narratives.<br><br>

                Beyond data analytics, I have a keen interest in web development, having created projects 
                like a library management system and an engaging quiz game. This fusion of data analytics 
                and web development allows me to blend analytical thinking with creative problem-solving.

                I'm excited to explore new opportunities, collaborate on exciting projects, and continue 
                expanding my skills at the intersection of technology, data, and design. <br><br>
                
                Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch to discuss how we can bring innovation 
                and insights to your projects together!
